Ants_Project
============
This is a CS61A class project assigned by professor John DeNero in Fall '13.

In this project, I created a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees.
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions: bees sting ants, and ants throw leaves at bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee flotilla has been vanquished (you win).
